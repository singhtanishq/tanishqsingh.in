                <h2>I. Scope of Services</h2>
                <p>The website <strong>www.tanishqsingh.in</strong> is primarily operated as a personal and professional portfolio platform managed by <strong>Tanishq Singh</strong>. The site is intended to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Showcase creative, technical, and professional work completed by Tanishq Singh, including but not limited to design projects, development portfolios, writings, or case studies.</li>
                    <li>Provide background information, experience, skills, and achievements to potential clients, collaborators, or employers.</li>
                    <li>Enable visitors to initiate communication for inquiries, collaborations, consulting, freelance projects, or other professional engagements.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The website does not function as a commercial marketplace or automated service portal. All services are provided manually, on a case-by-case basis, following direct communication through official channels (such as email or contact forms).</p>

                <h3>1. Informational Nature</h3>
                <p>The website's primary purpose is informational. While it describes potential services or professional capabilities, it does not constitute a legally binding offer, contract, or guarantee of availability. All service engagements are subject to mutual discussion, written agreement, and confirmation between you and Tanishq Singh.</p>

                <h3>2. Communication and Engagement Process</h3>
                <p>If you wish to engage in professional collaboration, you may reach out using the provided contact methods. Upon receiving your inquiry, Tanishq Singh may request additional information, project details, timelines, or objectives. Any agreement, quotation, or proposal shared via email or written correspondence shall take precedence over the general descriptions listed on the website.</p>

                <h3>3. Third-Party Tools and Integrations</h3>
                <p>The website may use third-party services such as Google Analytics, GitHub, LinkedIn embeds, or email automation tools to improve performance, communication, and analytics. While these integrations enhance functionality, your interaction with such services is governed by their respective terms and privacy policies.</p>

                <h3>4. No Automatic Client Relationship</h3>
                <p>Contacting Tanishq Singh through the website or submitting an inquiry does not automatically establish a client relationship. A formal engagement occurs only after written confirmation, mutual acceptance of scope, and where applicable, signed documentation or digital acceptance of a proposal.</p>
